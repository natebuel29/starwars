# Star Wars

Live:https://natebuel29.github.io/starwars/

A fun web-app to display all of the most important Star Wars information.
This was just a side project to help me practice using React.

## Info
- Recieved data from from The Star Wars API. (https://swapi.co/)
- Used a Node package called Tachyons to make styling easier. (https://tachyons.io/)

##Features
- Searchbox - The search box will narrow down the results of the data allowing the user to search for a specific character, planet, etc.
- Scroll - The Scroll compononent enables the user to view the list of Cards while still being able to view the header and buttons. This can be reused in other applications
